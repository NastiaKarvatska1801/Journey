# Journey
This repo contains a project related to tourist destinations.
In this REPO I will give an example of arranging a trip to a foreign city. It will include general description, sightseeing, stay and meals.
A number of websites relevant to this theme will also be given.
The main aim is to make your arrangments easy and effective, thus making your trip unforgettable.
All the examples given will be under the limits of low budget and will contain some tips how to spend money with the most use.
This time I have chosen to organise a trip to Berlin. It's one of the most prosperous and magnificent cities I have ever visited. 
For additional information you need to searth over the Internet. You may use this website - https://www.dw.com/de/themen/s-9077.
